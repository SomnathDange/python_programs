Difference between list and tuple
1) list is mutable , it can't be used as a key in a dictionary
   tuple is immutable , it can be used as a key in the dictionary
2) lists are homogeneous
   tuples are heterogeneous 
Why we need comma at the end of the tuples element:
   Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky.
   Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is in fact a tuple
   my_tuple = ("hello",)  
   print(type(my_tuple))
